This is a basic CLI password manager that I made as a personal project. Please, don't use this for storing sensitive data...

It uses a MongoDB database connection to store all the passwords. It also can generate a random password if necessary. Also uses the own DB user authentication data to access the stored data, for that reason you have to create your own DB on Atlas to give it a Try. 

Any help to improve this PM will be truly appreciated.
